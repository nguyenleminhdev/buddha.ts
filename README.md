# Buddha.ts

Buddha.ts is a backend framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Sails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of API development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.

## Installation &nbsp;
**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://nodejs.org/en/download)(@^14):**
```sh
# Install require packages
$ npm install
```

## Npm script

**Start app develop and hot reload:**
```sh
# start with development environment
npm run dev

# start with staging environment
npm run staging

# start with production environment
npm run prod
```

**Deploy app with pm2 installed:**
```sh
# at local device
npm run build

# at server
pm2 start pm2/<something>
```

## Compatibility

Buddha.ts is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Mongooese](http://mongooese.com/).

Buddha.ts actions are compatible with Connect middleware, so in most cases, you can paste code into Buddha.ts from an existing Express project and everything will work-- plus you'll be able to use WebSockets to talk to your API, and vice versa.
